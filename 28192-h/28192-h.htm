<h2>MR. TURTLE'S FLYING<br />
ADVENTURE</h2><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3>MR. TURTLE TELLS ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD
AND EXPLAINS A VERY OLD FABLE</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time, when it was early
summer in the Big Deep Woods, the
Hollow Tree people and Jack Rabbit went
over to spend the day with Mr. Turtle, who
lives in a very nice stone house which he
built himself on the edge of the Wide Blue
Water. Mr. Turtle fishes a good deal, and
makes most of his living that way, and knows
all the best places, so when his friends came
he said that perhaps they would enjoy fishing
a little&mdash;which they could do and sit in a
pleasant place at the same time, and talk,
and look out over the Wide Blue Water,
which was especially blue at this season.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="339" height="400" alt="A CATFISH NEARLY JERKED HIS POLE OUT OF HIS HANDS" title="" />
<span class="caption">A CATFISH NEARLY JERKED HIS POLE OUT OF HIS HANDS</span>
</div>

<p>That just suited the Hollow Tree people,
for they enjoyed fishing when they had
somebody to pick out a good place, and Mr.
'Possum found a nice stump to lean back
against, and presently went to sleep, but was
waked up soon after, when a big catfish
nearly jerked his pole out of his hands.
Mr. 'Possum had to use all his strength to
pull it out.</p>

<p>Then he was so proud he didn't think about
going to sleep again, and told how all his
family had been quite smart at catching
fish; and pretty soon Jack Rabbit caught
a good-sized perch, and Mr. 'Coon hooked a
croppie, which got away the first time,
though he caught it the next; and Mr. Crow
caught a "punkin-seed," which made the
others laugh, because it is a funny little fish;
while Mr. Turtle just went right along
pulling out one kind after another, without
saying a word, because fishing is his business
and doesn't excite him.</p>

<p>Then by and by the fish stopped biting,
as they 'most always do, by spells, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Deep Woods people leaned back and looked
out over the Wide Blue Water, and away out
there saw Mr. Eagle swoop down and pick
up something which looked at first like a
shoe-string; then they saw it wriggle, and
knew it was a small water-snake, which was
going to be Mr. Eagle's dinner; and they
talked about it and wondered how he could
enjoy such food.</p>

<p>Mr. Turtle said that Mr. Eagle enjoyed a
good many kinds of food, and that he was
reminded of an adventure he once had himself
with Mr. Eagle, when he (Mr. Turtle, of
course) was quite small. Then they all
asked Mr. Turtle to tell them his adventure,
because they thought it must have been
exciting if it was anything like the snake's
adventure which they had just witnessed.
Mr. Turtle said it was&mdash;quite a good deal
like it, in some ways&mdash;then he said:</p>

<p>"That was the only time I ever flew, or
ever had a chance to, or ever wanted to, that
I can remember. Very likely you have
already heard how once, a long time ago, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
thought I could fly, and persuaded an eagle
to take me up in the air to give me a start.
That old story has been told a good deal, and
I believe has even been put into some of
Mr. Man's books for his children to read."</p>

<p>Mr. Turtle paused, and the others all said
they did remember something of a story of
that sort, but never thought it had really
happened, because, knowing Mr. Turtle as
they did, they didn't believe any of his family
would try such an experiment.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Turtle, "it did really
happen, though not in the way you have
heard. You are right about thinking my
family would not care to experiment in that
way, and would not do it unless somebody
else arranged it for them and gave the
experiment a good start."</p>

<p>Mr. Turtle went on to say that in this case
it was Mr. Eagle and one of the ancient
ancestors of the little water-snake he had just
carried off that had started the experiment,
though he thought none of it had been really
planned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was very small then," Mr. Turtle went
on, "about the size of Mr. Man's fist, though
I suppose much heavier, for my shell was
very thick for my age, and everybody said
that if I lived a thousand years or so I might
have a shell as big and thick as the one that
Father Storm Turtle, up at the Forks, uses
to make the thunder with.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Then they
would laugh and say that Old Man Moccasin,
up at the Drifts, would certainly have trouble
with his digestion if he ever caught me;
which used to scare my mother, for Old Man
Moccasin was the biggest water-snake that
anybody ever saw, and there was nobody
around the Wide Blue Water that didn't
give him room, especially fish-fry, and Mr.
Frog, and young turtles like me, and even
some older ones. My mother used to warn us
children all the time, and scold us every day
about going away so far from the house and
not keeping a good watch-out for Old Man
Moccasin, who would surely get us, she said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
unless we were more careful. Then she
would tell us to look out for Mr. Eagle, too,
who was likely any time to come soaring
about, and would pick up any food he saw
lying handy.</p>

<p>"Well, it used to scare us when we thought
about it. Old Man Moccasin was seven feet
long, and I judge about half a foot thick.
He could lift himself two feet out of the water
when he was swimming, and with his far-sighted
glasses on could see a mile. Mr.
Eagle was fully twice as big as any of the
Eagle family I know of nowadays, and didn't
need any glasses to see an article the size of a
bug floating on the Wide Blue Water, no
matter how high he was flying. We tried
to keep a lookout in several directions, but,
of course, as we got older without accidents,
we grew careless, and our mother used to
count us every night and be surprised that
we were all there, and give us a good scolding
to go to bed on.</p>

<p>"Nothing happened to any of us for a good
while, and then it happened to me. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the biggest and strongest of our lot, and had
the thickest shell, and I liked to show how
grown-up I was, and would swim out farther,
and make believe I wasn't afraid any more
of Mr. Eagle and Old Man Moccasin, which
wasn't true, of course, for Mr. Eagle could
have handled me with one claw and Old Man
Moccasin could have swallowed me like a
pill and enjoyed the operation.</p>

<p>"Well, one day I was showing off more
than usual and had paddled out farther
toward the Drifts, saying to the others that
I was going to pay a call on Old Man
Moccasin. I kept on farther than I intended,
for it was a nice summer day and the water
felt good. I didn't know how far I had gone
until I turned around to look, and then I
didn't think about that any more, for a
quarter of a mile away, and between me and
the shore, was Old Man Moccasin, coming
straight in my direction. He was a good two
feet out of the water and had on his far-sighted
glasses, and I knew he was after me.
He was coming, too. He was swimming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with a wide, wavy motion, and making a little
curl of white foam in front, and leaving a
long trail behind.</p>

<p>"I was so scared, at first, that I couldn't
do anything. Then I thought I'd better
dive, but I knew that Old Man Moccasin
could swim faster under the water than on
top of it, and see just as well. I began to
paddle for dear life toward the other side of
the Wide Blue Water, which was a long way
off, with Old Man Moccasin gaining fast. I
knew he was bound to overtake me before
I got across, and I was getting weaker every
minute, from being so scared and trying so
hard, and I could hear Old Man Moccasin's
steady swimming noise coming closer all
the time.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="319" height="350" alt="&quot;OLD MAN MOCCASIN WAS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FEET AWAY&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;OLD MAN MOCCASIN WAS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FEET AWAY&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Of course it wasn't very long until I
gave up. I was too worn out to swim another
stroke. Old Man Moccasin was only about
twenty feet away, and when I looked back
at him over my shoulder I saw that he was
smiling because he was so sure he had me.
It was an awful smile, and I don't like to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
remember it often, even now, and that was
ever so long ago, as much as three hundred
and fourteen or fifteen years, this spring.</p>

<p>"Well, when I saw Old Man Moccasin at
that close distance, and smiling in that glad
way, and his spectacles shining, because he
was so pleased at the prospect, I said to
myself, I'm gone now, for certain, unless
something happens right off; though, of
course, I didn't see how anything <i>could</i>
happen, placed as I was. But just as I said
those words, something did happen&mdash;and
about the last thing I would have expected.
The first I saw was a big shadow, and the
first I heard was a kind of swish in the air,
and the first I knew I wasn't in the water
any more, but was on the way to the sky
with Mr. Eagle, who had one great claw
around my hind leg and another hooked over
my shell, not seeming to mind my weight at
all, and paying no attention to Old Man
Moccasin, who was beating his tail on the
water and calling Mr. Eagle bad names and
threatening him with everything he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
think of. I didn't know where I was going,
and couldn't see that I was much better off
than before, but I did enjoy seeing Old Man
Moccasin carry on about losing me, and I
called a few things to him that didn't make
him feel better. I said Mr. Eagle and I were
good friends, and asked him how he liked the
trick we had played on him. I even sang
out to him:</p>

<div class='poem'>"'Old Man Moccasin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">See you by and by;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mr. Eagle's teaching me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">How to learn to fly.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>which was a poem, and about the only one
I ever made, but it seemed to just come into
my head as we went sailing along. Mr.
Eagle, he heard it, too, and said:</div>

<p>"'Look here,' he said, 'what are you
talking about? You don't think you could
ever learn to fly, I hope?'</p>

<p>"'Why, yes, Mr. Eagle,' I said, 'if I just
had somebody like you to give me a few
lessons. Of course, nobody could ever fly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
as well as you can, but I'm sure I could learn
to fly some.'</p>

<p>"Then I thanked him for having saved me
from Old Man Moccasin, and said how kind
he was, and told him how my folks had always
told us what a great bird Mr. Eagle was&mdash;so
strong and grand, and the best flyer in the
world&mdash;and how we must always admire and
respect him and not get in his way, and how
I thought if I could only fly a little&mdash;perhaps
about as much as a hen&mdash;I could keep from
being caught by Old Man Moccasin, which
was the worst thing that could happen, and
wouldn't Mr. Eagle please give me a lesson.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Eagle said, very politely, that
he guessed he'd keep me from being caught
by Old Man Moccasin, but it wouldn't be
by teaching me to fly.</p>

<p>"'You couldn't fly any more than a stone,'
he said, 'and a stone can't fly at all.'</p>

<p>"'But a stone can't swim, either, Mr.
Eagle,' I said, 'and I can swim fine. I
could learn to swim right through the air&mdash;I
know I could&mdash;I can tell by the way I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
feel,' and I made some big motions with my
front legs, and kicked with my free hind leg
to show him how I would do it; and I really
did feel, the way that air was blowing past,
so fresh and strong, that if he would let go of
me I could swim in it a little, anyway.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Eagle laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"'You have to have wings to fly with,'
he said. 'You couldn't fly a foot. If I
should drop you, you'd go down like a shot,
and would probably break all to pieces!'</p>

<p>"I was looking down as he spoke, and I
noticed that we were passing over Mr. Man's
marsh meadows, for we were not flying very
high, and I could see locations quite plain,
and even some objects. I knew those
meadows were soft in places, for I had been
there once to a spring overflow picnic.
There were also a great number of little
hay-piles, which Mr. Man had raked up,
getting ready to make his big stacks when the
hay was dry. So I said, as quick as I
could:</p>

<p>"'Oh, Mr. Eagle, I am certain I could fly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
this minute. I never felt so much like it in
my life. Just give me a big swing, Mr. Eagle,
and let me try. If I fall and break, it won't
be your fault, and you can take the pieces
home to your family. I'll be handier for
them that way than any other.'</p>

<p>"When Mr. Eagle heard that, he laughed,
and said:</p>

<p>"'Well, that's so, anyway. You people
always are a tough proposition for my young
folks. Much obliged for the suggestion.'</p>

<p>"And just as he said that, Mr. Eagle quit
flying straight ahead and started to circle
around, as if he were looking for something,
and pretty soon I saw down there a flat
stone, and Mr. Eagle saw it, too, and stopped
still in the air right over it, as near as he could
judge, making all the time a big flapping
sound with his wings, until he got me aimed
to suit him, and I could feel him beginning
to loosen up his hold on my hind leg and shell.
Then, all of a sudden, he let me go.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="348" height="400" alt="&quot;NOW FLY!&quot; HE SAYS, AND DOWN I WENT" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;NOW FLY!&quot; HE SAYS, AND DOWN I WENT</span>
</div>

<p>"'Now fly!' he says, and down I went.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Eagle certainly told the truth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
about the way he said I'd drop. I made the
biggest kind of swimming motions in the
direction of one of those little haycocks, but
if I made any headway in that direction
I couldn't notice it. I didn't have time,
anyway. It seemed to me that I struck
bottom almost before I started from the top;
still, I must have turned myself over, for I
landed on my back, exactly in the center of
that flat stone, Mr. Eagle being a center shot.</p>

<p>"He was wrong, though, about me
breaking to pieces, and so was the story
you've heard. Our family don't break very
easy, and as I said before, my shell was thick
and tough for my age. It was the stone that
broke, and probably saved my life, for if I
had hit in a soft place in that marsh meadow
I'd have gone down out of sight and never
been able to dig out.</p>

<p>"As it was, I bounced some, and landed
right side up close to one of those little
haycocks, and had just about sense and
strength enough left to scrabble under it
before Mr. Eagle came swooping down after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
me, for he saw what had happened and
didn't lose any time.</p>

<p>"But he was too late, for I was under that
haycock, and Mr. Eagle had never had much
practice in pitching hay. He just clawed at
it on different sides and abused me as hard
as he could for deceiving him, as he called it,
and occasionally I called back to him, and
tried to soothe him, and told him I was
sorry not to come out and thank him in
person, but I was so shaken up by the fall
that I must rest and collect myself. Then,
by and by he pretended to be very sweet,
and said I had done so well the first time,
I ought to take another lesson, and if I'd
come out we'd try it again.</p>

<p>"But I said I couldn't possibly take
another lesson to-day, and for him to come
back to-morrow, when I had got over the
first one; and then I heard him talking to
himself and saying it was growing late and
he must be getting home with something to
eat for those brats, and pretty soon I heard
his big wing sound; but I didn't come out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for I thought he was most likely just trying
to fool me, and was sailing around overhead
and waiting, which I still think he was, for
a while. After a long time, though, I worked
over where I could see out a little, and then
I found it was night, and, of course, Mr. Eagle
had really gone home.</p>

<p>"So then I worked along across the
meadows, being pretty sore and especially
lame in the left hind leg, where Mr. Eagle
had gripped me, though I felt better when I
got into the Wide Blue Water and was
swimming toward home. It took me all
night to get there, and the folks were so
worried they couldn't sleep, for some one
had seen Old Man Moccasin out in the
middle of the water, chasing something, during
the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Well, of course I told everything that had
happened, and almost everybody in the Wide
Blue Water came to hear about it, and they
told it to others, and Old Man Moccasin
heard so much about how Mr. Eagle had
fooled him, and how I had fooled Mr. Eagle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that he moved to another drift, farther down,
and probably lives there still. And Mr.
Eagle heard so much about the way he tried
to teach me to fly that he made up a story of
his own and flew in all directions, telling it;
and that is the story most people know about
to-day and the one that Mr. Man put into
his books. But it isn't true, and I can
prove it."</p>

<p>Mr. Turtle got up and turned around
toward the Hollow Tree people. He had his
coat off, and he reached back and pointed to
a place about in the center of his shell.</p>

<p>"Feel right there," he said, which Mr.
Rabbit did, and said:</p>

<p>"Why, there's quite a lump there. It
hardly shows, but you can feel it plainly."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="358" height="450" alt="&quot;YES,&quot; SAID MR. TURTLE, &quot;THAT&#39;S WHERE I STRUCK&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;YES,&quot; SAID MR. TURTLE, &quot;THAT&#39;S WHERE I STRUCK&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Turtle, "that's where I
struck. It was quite sore for a good while.
There was a lump there, at first, as big as an
egg. It flattened a good deal afterward,
but it never quite went away. Feel how
smooth it is. It kept just about as it was
when it happened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Then all those other Deep Woods people
came up and felt of the queer lump on Mr.
Turtle's back, and said how perfectly that
proved everything and how Mr. Turtle
always could prove things, and they noticed
the inscription about the old race with Mr.
Hare, and said in some ways Mr. Turtle was
about the most wonderful person anywhere
and they were certainly proud to be his
friends.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Turtle said they might all sit
there and talk about it a little, while he went
in to cook the fish and make a pan of biscuits
and a nice salad for dinner.</p>

<h3>MR. 'POSSUM TELLS ABOUT AUNT MELISSY
AND UNCLE SILAS AND THE ROMANCE
OF MINTY GLENWOOD</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONE night in the Hollow Tree, when the
'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black
Crow had finished their supper and were
sitting around the fire, smoking, Mr. 'Possum
said that he thought he had heard Mr. Frog
trying off a few notes to-day, over in the
Wide Grasslands, so that he knew that it
must be coming spring, and Mr. 'Coon said
that over Mr. Man's way he had smelled
burning leaves, which was a pretty sure sign.
Then Mr. Crow said that some of his wild
relatives had been cawing about lately, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that was a sign, too. Then they all smoked
some more, and looked in the fire, and were
glad that winter was about over, and
presently Mr. 'Possum said that every time
he smelled the spring smell, and heard the
spring sounds, it reminded him of something
that happened a long time ago, when he was
quite young and lived with his Uncle Silas
and Aunt Melissy Lovejoy, over beyond the
Wide Blue Water. Then the 'Coon and the
Old Black Crow begged Mr. 'Possum to tell
about it, because they said Mr. 'Possum's
stories always sounded so unbelievable, and
yet always turned out to be almost founded
on fact.</div>

<p>"Well," said Mr. 'Possum, "you remember
I told you about Uncle Silas Lovejoy going
to the city, once, and coming home all
stylish, with a young man to wait on him,
and how Aunt Melissy, when she saw them,
turned the young man into just a plain hired
help and set them both to work in the garden;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and you may remember how I once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
told you about all our folks, including the
hired man, being moved by a balloon across
the Wide Blue Water and set down right at
the very door of a fine hollow tree, which we
moved into and enjoyed for a long time&mdash;my
little cousins and myself growing up there, and
some of them still living there to this day."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum stopped to fill his pipe again,
and the others all said they remembered,
and Mr. 'Coon said he always liked the nice
slow and reminding way Mr. 'Possum began
his stories, as it brought everything up fresh,
and one didn't have to be trying to think of
what had happened before, but could just sit
back and listen. Mr. 'Possum nodded, and
lit his pipe, and leaned back and drew a few
puffs, as if he enjoyed them so much that he
didn't care to go on with his story. But
pretty soon he said:</p>

<p>"We lived there till I grew up, and all my
little cousins, too, and the hired man stayed
with us. He was a very good young man;
though, being brought up in town, of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it took him a little while to get used to
country ways. But Aunt Melissy was a
stirring person and she didn't let it take as
long as it might have in another family.
Aunt Melissy was quite primpy herself, and
said that she guessed she could carry what
style there was in our family (being a
Glenwood, and having married beneath
her), and that Uncle Silas and the rest of us
would do pretty well if we managed to keep
up with the work she laid out for us; and
that was so.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="359" height="450" alt="&quot;SHE WOULD MAKE WINTERS HELP MY YOUNG LADY COUSIN DO THE DISHES&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SHE WOULD MAKE WINTERS HELP MY YOUNG LADY COUSIN DO THE DISHES&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"She kept Uncle Silas and Winters&mdash;that
was the name of the hired man&mdash;busier than
anybody, as she never quite got over the
trip to town and the way they came home.
She used to set Uncle Silas to peeling
potatoes, after supper, for next morning,
and would make Winters help my young
lady cousin do the dishes, which you would
not think he would like; but he did. Aunt
Melissy didn't know that he would like it
so much, or she would have set him at the
potatoes, and Uncle Silas at the dishes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't suppose any of you can guess why
our hired man wanted to help my cousin,
Minta Glenwood Lovejoy, with the dishes.
I couldn't, even after I saw that he was so
fond of the job that he could hardly wait
until the supper was cleared away and it was
ready for him. I used to wonder how that
young man, brought up in town, could take
so to such work, and then, after a while, I
got to wondering why it took him and Minty
Glenwood, as we always called her, so long
to get through.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="376" height="450" alt="&quot;UNCLE SILAS HAD GONE TO SLEEP WITH A POTATO IN HIS HAND&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;UNCLE SILAS HAD GONE TO SLEEP WITH A POTATO IN HIS HAND&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"That was the first thing Aunt Melissy
wondered, too. She generally knit a little,
after supper, and went to sleep over it, and
would wake up suddenly and look at the clock
and begin to knit as fast as she could, so we
would not think she had been asleep. But
one night she slept a long time, and when she
looked at the clock it was so late that she
said, 'Land's sakes, it's bedtime!' and she
went over and shook Uncle Silas, who had
gone to sleep with a potato in his hand, and
scolded him to bed, and shook up the rest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
us, and then noticed that Cousin Minty and
Winters were missing, and went straight to
the kitchen door and opened it, and found
them sitting close together, and Winters
holding Cousin Minty's hand and telling her
that unless she would set up housekeeping
with him he would go back to the city and
lead a fearful life; and Cousin Minty Lovejoy
looking very scared.</p>

<p>"But she didn't look half as scared as she
did when she saw Aunt Melissy, nor the hired
man, either. He had to make two trials
before he could get up, even after Aunt
Melissy told him to, and Cousin Minty
Glenwood began to cry, and Aunt Melissy
told her to go to bed at once, and made a
swing at her, and missed her, as she went by.
She didn't miss the hired man, though; and
I guess he had something else to think of
besides Minty Glenwood and housekeeping,
for a few minutes, anyway.</p>

<p>"Then Aunt Melissy Lovejoy told him he
could take himself out of that house, and not
come back except for meals, and she said he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
could sleep over in the shop, which was an old,
leaky, broken stump of a tree where we kept
our garden tools. Then I happened to be
sitting in the way, and Aunt Melissy tripped
over my feet, and when she righted herself
she made a swing at me, too; and if I had
not dodged in time I might have been injured
for life. As it was, she drove me out with
Winters to stay in the shop, and I wasn't
sorry, for it was an awful time in our house.</p>

<p>"Next morning, Aunt Melissy Lovejoy
was still dangerous, and at breakfast she
broke out at things in general, and said the
idea that she, a Glenwood, should live to see
a hired man sitting up to a child of hers,
especially one who was a Glenwood herself,
resembling the family as she did, and being
named that way, too; which seemed worse,
somehow, than anything that ever happened
to a Glenwood before, except her own case;
and she gave an awful look at Uncle Silas,
who got a little spunky&mdash;the only time I ever
saw him that way&mdash;and said he thought that
Winters was quite a good fellow and would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
make as good a husband as <i>he</i> had, meaning
himself, of course, and Aunt Melissy said,
'Yes, just about,' and asked him if he
wanted his daughter to have as hard a row
to hoe as <i>she</i> had, meaning <i>herself</i>, though it
was Uncle Silas who had the hard hoeing in
that family, if I could judge.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="346" height="450" alt="&quot;THAT NIGHT WINTERS AND I TALKED IT OVER&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THAT NIGHT WINTERS AND I TALKED IT OVER&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, that night in the shop, Winters and
I talked it over, and he decided to go away
and take Minty Glenwood with him. He
might go to the city, he said, to his folks, who
had disowned him because he had been quite
wild, but very likely would take him back
now that he had reformed and was ready to
be tamed by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'an ice'">a nice</ins> little person like Minty
Glenwood. He and Minty would have to
elope, of course, and he told me to tell her
just what to do, because I could get to see
her alone, which he couldn't. There was a
little sapling grew near the tree, and one of
its limbs stuck out above her window.
Winters said he would go out on that limb
and bend it down, about midnight, and
Minty Glenwood could be there and climb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
out on it, and they would go away together
quite a distance from Aunt Melissy, and live
happy ever after.</p>

<p>"So I told Cousin Minty Glenwood about
the plan, and just what to do, and she was as
scared as a chicken, but said she would do
anything to save the hired man from that
awful city life he had mentioned. She said
she knew something would happen when she
tried to climb out her window, but she would
have to do it, as it was the only way to get
out without going through Aunt Melissy's
room, which would be much worse.</p>

<p>"Well, that night Winters and I got
everything ready, and had all his things
packed in a bundle at the foot of the tree,
and a little before midnight by the full moon
Winters went up and crawled out on the limb
to bend it down, but when he got there it
wouldn't bend far enough to reach Minty
Glenwood's window&mdash;him being a lightweight
person, though I've heard he got
fatter later on. He couldn't jump on it, for
fear of waking up Aunt Melissy, so he came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
down and said I would have to go out on
the limb, and he would stay on the ground
with the things, because I was always pretty
solid, even in those days. So then I went out
and crawled along on that limb, which bent
down with me, all right, but didn't quite
reach Minty Glenwood's window, and I
couldn't see how she was going to get on it
unless she jumped, which I never thought
she'd do.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="303" height="300" alt="&quot;SENT ME SAILING UP INTO THE SKY&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SENT ME SAILING UP INTO THE SKY&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"But you never can tell what a young
person in love <i>will</i> do. She was there
waiting, all dressed in her Sunday things,
with a big bundle of what she was going to
take along, and when I asked her, in a
whisper, if she could jump and grab the limb,
she didn't wait to think about it, or to give
me notice to get ready, but just jumped,
bundle and all, and grabbed the limb with
one hand and me with the other, and down
we swung, for Minty Glenwood was plump,
too, and quite heavy with the bundle, and
then she let go and dropped, which I should
have done, only I forgot it, and a second later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that limb sprang back and sent me sailing
up into the sky just about in the direction of
the full moon.</p>

<p>"Minty Glenwood landed all right&mdash;on
her bundle, I heard later&mdash;and she and
Winters had probably got a good ways on
their wedding journey by the time I came
down in a brush-heap, where we had been
clearing up a new potato-patch. It broke
my fall, but it was very stiff, scratchy
brush, and when I got out I felt as if I had
been in an argument with Mr. Wildcat. I
was limping, too, and afraid I was injured
internally, for I didn't feel hungry, which is
always a bad sign. I was taking on a good
deal, and making some noise, I suppose, for
when I got to the shop and was going to drag
myself up to bed, I heard Aunt Melissy's
voice call out the window:</p>

<p>"'What's the matter with you out there?
What have you been doing?' And then all
at once she gave a howl, for she was in Minty
Glenwood's room, and had suddenly discovered
that Cousin Minty wasn't in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bed, and hadn't been in it that night. About
five seconds later she came tearing out there
in the moonlight and grabbed me and says:</p>

<p>"'What does this mean?' she says.
'Where's your Cousin Minty Glenwood
and that hired creature, Winters?'</p>

<p>"I could tell from Aunt Melissy's looks and
voice that it was not a good time to tell it
just as it was. I said I had done all I could
to save Minty Glenwood from sorrow, but
I had been bruised and scratched in the
attempt, and she could see herself that I was
bleeding in as many as fifty places and could
hardly walk. Very likely, I said, I would not
live long enough to tell all the tale, and that
I didn't know which way those two fierce
young people had gone, which was true
enough.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="347" height="375" alt="&quot;HE LAUGHED MORE THAN I EVER SAW HIM LAUGH AT ANYTHING&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE LAUGHED MORE THAN I EVER SAW HIM LAUGH AT ANYTHING&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Then Uncle Silas came out and pretended
to be very mad, too, and said it was a shame
the way I had been treated. As for Minty
Glenwood, she was not worth hunting for,
and he would disown her from that moment,
though I knew he was as glad as he could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that it happened, and had a pretty good idea
I had something to do with it. Aunt Melissy
she stormed and carried on, and said
her family was ruined and that she was going
back to her folks; but she had got more
peaceful-like by morning, and put some
poultices and bandages on me, and said she
didn't see how in time that little, spindly
hired man and a mere girl could get a big,
strong fellow like me into such a state,
though, she said, of course Minty was a
Glenwood and the Glenwoods were always
fighters. Then she took me back to the tree,
and gave me Minty Glenwood's room; and
when she was out Uncle Silas came to sit
with me, and I told him all about it, and he
laughed more than I ever saw him laugh at
anything, especially when I told about how
I went sailing into that brush-heap. Uncle
Silas always did like anything funny, and he
hadn't many chances to show his taste.</p>

<p>"Well, my appetite came back, but I
didn't get well till I had to, because as long
as I could be in bed and seem dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Uncle Silas had an excuse to sit with me, and
we had a fine time. But by and by Aunt
Melissy made up some of the worst medicine
I ever tasted, which she said she thought
would cure me if anything would; which it
did, the first dose. Aunt Melissy stayed
pretty savage, though, until one day word
came from Minty Glenwood, who was now
Mrs. Winters, that they were living in town,
and that Mr. Winters's people were very fine
and stylish and well off, and had taken him
back because he had married so well and
reformed, and she was as happy as could be.
Then you ought to have seen Aunt Melissy
show off. Any one would have thought she
had made the match, and she couldn't
talk enough about Minty Glenwood living
in the city, and our fine Winters relatives;
and told Uncle Silas he ought to be ashamed
of the things he'd said about Minty Glenwood,
and ordered him to take them all back,
which he did. Then, by and by, she went
to visit the Winters folks, and stayed a long
time, and Uncle Silas and I and my other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
cousins had the best time we ever had in
our lives. When Aunt Melissy came back
she looked as fancy and put on almost as
many airs as Uncle Silas had the time he came
home and brought the young man who by
and by was to marry Minty Glenwood."</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum sleepily knocked the ashes
out of his pipe and yawned and looked into
the fire.</p>

<p>"Did you or Uncle Silas ever tell Aunt
Melissy about helping Minty Glenwood and
Winters to get away?" asked Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. 'Possum, drowsily; "we
knew Aunt Melissy, and thought it was a
pretty good plan to let well enough alone."</p>

<h2>IN MR. MAN'S CAR</h2><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE HOLLOW TREE PEOPLE HAVE ONE OF
THEIR MOST EXCITING ADVENTURES</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time Mr. Dog came over
to have supper with the Hollow Tree
people, and to tell them some news. This,
of course, was after he had become good
friends with the 'Coon and 'Possum and the
Old Black Crow, and enjoyed dropping in for
a smoke and a little conversation, especially
about Mr. Man's doings, which always interested
the Hollow Tree people and their
friends.</div>

<p>So on this particular night, when the
supper-things had been cleared away, and
they all had lit their pipes and Mr. Dog was
sitting outside to enjoy the mild evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he told them something very astonishing.
He said he supposed that they had now over
at their house (meaning, of course, at Mr.
Man's house) the most wonderful thing in
the world. He said it was called an automobile,
and was a kind of large carriage,
but the strange part about it was that it
went without any horse or any kind of live
thing at all. When Mr. Man brought it
home, Mr. Dog said, their Mr. Horse had
been looking over the fence into the road,
and when he saw that strange object, with
Mr. Man sitting in it, holding to a wheel,
go flying by, twice as fast as Mr. Horse could
run, also making much more noise, and
trailing smoke, Mr. Horse gave one snort
and took out for the back lots, and they
hadn't seen him since. Mr. Dog owned that
he himself had thought it best to go under
the house, and that he had spent a good deal
of the first day there watching Mr. Man
open a number of doors and covers that were
attached to the new machine, which seemed
to be full of sudden noises that Mr. Man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
could stop whenever he wanted to, though
he was not always able to start them with
the handle that he turned for that purpose.
Sometimes Mr. Man had to turn the handle
until he was quite weak before he could get
a single noise, and without the noise the
carriage would not start.</p>

<p>Mr. Dog said that at first he had been
rather uncertain in his feelings toward the
automobile, but that, little by little, he had
felt more friendly and had come up closer
to look at it, only going back under the house
again when it started one of those sudden
sounds which seemed to make his head ache.
Then he got used to those, too, and about the
third day Mr. Man suddenly caught him by
the collar and invited him to ride, and put
him in the back of the carriage, and tied
him there with a strong rope so he wouldn't
fall out, and so nobody would steal him,
because Mr. Man valued him so highly.</p>

<p>Mr. Dog said that when the automobile
started he almost wished he <i>could</i> fall out,
at first, or that somebody would steal him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
because he was sure it would affect his heart,
and that when they got to going faster and
faster he forgot about the rope, and even
tried to jump out, but the rope was quite
a good one, and probably saved his life.
Then pretty soon he didn't want to jump out
any more, and laid down on the floor to
enjoy it, and was sorry to get home. When
Mr. Man was ready to start, next time, Mr.
Dog jumped in himself, and the faster they
went the better he liked it, and now when
they went he often sat up in the front seat
by the side of Mr. Man, and if the car was
all full of Mr. Man's folks he sometimes sat
behind on the top when it was folded back
for fine weather. Mr. Dog said there was
nothing in the world that he loved so much
as to ride in an automobile and to go fast.
He said they often went so fast that they
passed some of the birds, and that then he
would bark loudly to show his enjoyment.</p>

<p>Well, when the Hollow Tree people heard
about Mr. Man's automobile they at first
could hardly say anything at all. Then Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
'Possum said he supposed what made it go
was some kind of clockwork that Mr. Man
wound up when he turned that crank; and
Mr. Crow thought he must build a fire in it
to make the smoke come out behind. Mr.
Dog didn't know, himself, just how the
machinery went in, but that Mr. Man
called it a motor and had ever so many
names for different parts of it, and sometimes
said strong words when he took one of the
parts out and couldn't get it back again
without trouble. The wheels ran on rubber,
he said, rubber filled with air, which Mr. Man
pumped into them, and when anything
happened to let the air out they had to stop,
and then Mr. Man would change the rubber
wheel and pump a good deal, and say strong
words again, especially when it was warm.
Mr. Dog said it was a great comfort to sit
back in the shade at such times, and watch
Mr. Man pump, and hear him say all the
things that he used to say to Mr. Dog
himself when he had made some little mistake
or had come home later than usual. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
said he had never prized anything in his life
so much as he had that car, which was what
Mr. Man generally called it.</p>

<p>Well, the Hollow Tree people were
certainly excited. They said they surely
must see that new carriage of Mr. Man's,
and if Mr. Dog would send them word some
day when he was going out they would hide
in the bushes by the road and watch him go
by. Mr. Dog said he would do that, and
that he and Mr. Man generally took an early
ride together, before the rest of the family
were stirring, to get some things at the store
down at Great Corners&mdash;mostly, of late,
things for the automobile, which seemed to
consume a great deal of smelly liquid, and
oils, and all kinds of hardware.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Coon said he would give anything
in the world to see that automobile
going by with the smoke streaming out
behind, and Mr. Dog sitting up in the front
seat. Mr. Crow said he would give anything
in the world to see that, and to slip over to
Mr. Man's barn some time when nobody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was at home, and really examine the new
object, and maybe sit in the seats a little.
And Mr. 'Possum said he would give a good
deal for all that, but that what he really
wanted to do was to sit in the car and ride,
like Mr. Dog, as fast as the thing could go.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow both
together said, "Oh, we never could do that&mdash;never
in the world!" and Mr. Dog didn't
say anything at all&mdash;not at first&mdash;but sat
thinking. Then by and by he said, all at
once:</p>

<p>"I know," he said&mdash;"I know a way that
you can get to take a ride in our new car.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
There is quite a big space under the back
seat where Mr. Man keeps his pump and
sometimes other things, but he keeps most
of his things in a tool-box on the side, and
only looks into the back-seat place when he
needs the pump. When we start out for a
long trip he puts Mrs. Man's and Miss
Man's extra hats and things in there, but
there are none of those articles there now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
So if you should come over very early to-morrow
morning, before Mr. Man is up,
and get into that place under the back seat,
you would have just about room enough,
and while you couldn't see much, except
maybe a little of the road through cracks in
the bottom, you would be riding all the time,
and always afterward could tell how it felt."</p>

<p>Well, that was such a scary thought that
at first the Hollow Tree people couldn't do
anything but just sit and shiver and think
about how grand and exciting it would be,
but how awful if anything should happen.
Suppose Mr. Man should have to use his
pump, what would be likely to happen
then? No one could tell. Mr. Dog said
they would have to jump and step lively then,
sure enough.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;MR. &#39;POSSUM TRIED TO TURN THE CRANK A LITTLE&quot;</span>
</div>


<p>So then they talked about it and gave up
the thought, and went on talking about it
and giving it up some more, until Mr.
'Possum said that, so far, the worst had never
happened to him yet, and that he would
take chances if the rest would; and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
'Coon said it would probably be the end of all
of them, but he'd risk it; and Mr. Crow said
he wouldn't care to pass his life in the
Hollow Tree alone, and he might as well go
with the others. Then Mr. Dog skipped
home as fast as he could go, to listen around
and see what Mr. Man's plans were for the
next morning, so he would know if they
were going on their early trip to Great
Corners, as usual, or on some excursion.
But he didn't hear anything about a picnic
before bedtime, and next morning he was up
a little before day, and pretty soon the
Hollow Tree people came slipping over,
nearly scared to death, and Mr. Dog let
them in by his special door to the barn, and
they all looked at the automobile, and Mr.
'Possum tried to turn the crank a little, and
Mr. 'Coon sat up in the front seat and took
hold of the steering-wheel and pretended to
be driving, and Mr. Crow said he didn't
see how a thing that seemed so cold and dead
as that could suddenly come to life and
move.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;">

<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="353" height="300" alt="MADE A DIVE FOR THE REAR SEAT" title="" />
<span class="caption">MADE A DIVE FOR THE REAR SEAT</span>
</div>

<p>Then Mr. Dog said he heard Mr. Man
coming down his back stairs, and they all
made a dive for the rear seat, and Mr. Dog
put the cushion in place and was outside
waiting and barking "Good morning" to Mr.
Man when he opened the big barn doors.</p>

<p>Then the Hollow Tree people were nearly
dead with scare. Mr. 'Possum whispered
that he knew that his heart was beating so
loud that Mr. Man could hear it and would
think his motor was going, and Mr. 'Coon
said if Mr. Man should ever move that back
cushion he knew he should die. Mr. Crow
said he felt sure this was just some awful
nightmare, and that he would wake up pretty
soon, and he said of all the dreams he ever
had, this was the worst.</p>

<p>But just then Mr. Man got hold of the
crank in front of the car and gave it a turn,
and then gave it another turn, and then said
something, and gave it another turn, and
suddenly the Hollow Tree people heard a
great number of loud explosions which made
them perfectly cold, and then there was just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a heavy roar and rumble, and they heard
Mr. Man say to Mr. Dog, "Come, get in!"
and they felt the automobile begin to move.</p>

<p>That was an awful sensation at first.
They could feel that they were going, but
the soft rubber wheels did not rattle on the
road, and about the only sound was the
motor, which they could tell was getting
faster and faster as they got out into the
smooth road across the Wide Grass Lands,
and now and then Mr. Dog barking to them
in Hollow Tree language that everything was
all right and to rest easy and enjoy themselves&mdash;that
they were just then passing the
Four Oaks, and that presently they would be
in the Sugar Hollow Road, and that he wished
they could see out and notice how things
went spinning by. Then they heard Mr.
Man tell Mr. Dog not to make so much
noise, and after that things were quieter,
and they just heard the steady buzz of the
engine, until by and by Mr. Dog barked out
that they were at Great Corners and were
stopping in front of the store.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hollow Tree people whispered to one
another that they had certainly enjoyed it,
but what a terrible thing it would be if
something should happen now, so far away
from home, and among so many confusing
things. It seemed an age before Mr. Man
came back to the car and got ready to start
again, and when he did they heard him
talking to some other Mr. Man, who asked
if he should put the things under the back
seat. Then the Hollow Tree people nearly
died, until they heard Mr. Man say, "No,
never mind, I'm in too much of a hurry to
get home; just drop them in behind there,
any place," which made them feel a little
better, and pretty soon Mr. Man started the
motor again, and they felt the car moving
faster and faster, the same as before.</p>

<p>The Hollow Tree people couldn't see a
thing, but they knew they were riding faster
than ever, for they bounced about a good
deal, and held on to one another and would
have laughed at the fun if they hadn't been
too scared. They were pretty anxious for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Mr. Man to get the car back into the barn,
so they could scamper home as soon as he
went in to breakfast, for they had had about
all the excitement they wanted. But they got
some more in a minute, for all of a sudden,
just as Mr. Dog barked to them that they
were in the edge of the Big Deep Woods and
would be home soon, there came a good deal
rougher bumping, and then the car ran slow,
and stopped, and they heard Mr. Man say,
"A puncture, by gracious! Now I've got
to put in a half-hour at that pump!"</p>

<p>Those were awful words. He would be
back there in a minute, and then what? For
a second or two everything was silent, except
that they heard Mr. Man getting out
of the car, and they got ready to make a
wild jump the moment he lifted the seat
cover. But then&mdash;right at the instant when
they expected him to do it&mdash;they heard
Mr. Dog break right out into a great, big
bark, shouting as loud as he could:</p>

<p>"<i>Come! Come! Come! Mr. Man&mdash;it's up
a tree!&mdash;it's up a tree!&mdash;it's up a tree!</i>" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
they knew by the sound that he had jumped
out and was calling to Mr. Man to come into
the woods near the road, and then, a second
later, they heard him call to them, in Hollow
Tree words&mdash;"Now! now! jump and run!
Jump and run! Now! Now! <i>Now!</i> <i>Now!</i>"</p>

<p>And the Hollow Tree people didn't have
to be told again. All together, they gave a
great big push at the cover of the back seat,
and lifted it, cushion and all, and scrambled
out, and over the side of the car and out the
back, and were diving into the deep woods on
the other side of the road from Mr. Man, who
was looking up a tree and scolding Mr. Dog
because he couldn't see anything up there to
bark at.</p>

<p>The Hollow Tree people didn't wait to see
how it came out, but took out for home,
lickety-split, and didn't stop until they were
safe in the Hollow Tree. That night Mr.
Dog came over to see how they had enjoyed
it. He said Mr. Man called him several
names because he had not been able to see
anything up in the tree, and then had changed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the tire and pumped it while Mr. Dog was
getting calm. Mr. Man, he said, was
surprised to find the back cushion had
jumped out of place, but did not suspicion
the truth.</p>

<p>Then they all talked it over several times,
and were very proud of the great experience,
though they decided that they would not
try it again.</p>

<h3>MR. 'POSSUM SHOWS HE CAN INVENT THINGS,
ESPECIALLY AN AUTOMOBILE LIKE
MR. MAN'S</h3>


<div class='cap'>"YOU may remember," said the Storyteller,
one evening, to the Little Lady,
"my telling you about Mr. Man's automobile,
and how the Hollow Tree people,
Mr. 'Coon, Mr. 'Possum, and the Old Black
Crow, got a ride in it; how Mr. Dog helped
them, you know, and just barely managed
to keep them all from being caught by Mr.
Man."</div>

<p>"Why, yes," said the Little Lady, "and I
do hope they never wanted to take another.
They didn't, did they?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="356" height="450" alt="HE USED TO WALK UP AND DOWN IN THE SUN AND SMOKE, THINKING AND THINKING" title="" />
<span class="caption">HE USED TO WALK UP AND DOWN IN THE SUN AND SMOKE, THINKING AND THINKING</span>
</div>

<p>"Not in Mr. Man's car&mdash;no, they had had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
enough of that, but they were very much
excited over it, and thought if they could just
sit up in the seat and ride, like Mr. Dog, and
see things go by, and not be down under it,
in the dark and danger, they would enjoy
it more than anything. Mr. 'Possum
thought about it, and talked about it, more
than anybody, and after breakfast, while
Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow were doing up the
morning's work, he used to walk up and down
in the sun and smoke, thinking and thinking,
for Mr. 'Possum is quite thoughtful and a
good hand to plan, when work doesn't strain
his mind.</p>

<p>Well, one morning, when Mr. Crow and
Mr. 'Coon were all through, and came out
and sat on a log to smoke in the sun and
admire Mr. 'Possum, and think how smart
he was and how well he looked for his age,
he stopped all at once, right in front of them,
and said:</p>

<p>"I've got it!" he said. "I can do it! I
can make one as easy as anything!"</p>

<p>"Make what?" said the 'Coon and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Old Black Crow, both together, quite
excited.</p>

<p>"I can make an automobile," said Mr.
'Possum. "I have planned it all out. I am
going to commence now."</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow took their
pipes out of their mouths and looked at
Mr. 'Possum, but couldn't say a word, they
were so astonished.</p>

<p>But Mr. 'Possum just threw his head back
a little and blew some smoke, and said that
it had been quite hard to plan and had
taken all of his best thoughts, but that it
seemed easy enough now, and that he might
have it done by night.</p>

<p>Then the 'Coon and the Crow did get
excited, and said: "Oh yes, Mr. 'Possum,
we'll help you. Will you let us help you,
Mr. 'Possum?"</p>

<p>And Mr. 'Possum said that of course he
would have to do the most, as he would have
to show them how, but that they could do
all the easy things, and he said they might
begin by bringing down the big wood-box<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
out of Mr. Crow's kitchen, and the big
wood-saw, and the hammer, and some nails,
and any useful tool that they had borrowed
from time to time from Mr. Man during his
absence.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" width="362" height="450" alt="SIGHTED ACROSS IT TO SEE THAT THEY WERE KEEPING IT STRAIGHT" title="" />
<span class="caption">SIGHTED ACROSS IT TO SEE THAT THEY WERE KEEPING IT STRAIGHT</span>
</div>

<p>So then Mr. Coon and Mr. Crow ran up
and lugged down Mr. Crow's big wood-box,
and got the saw and all the other tools and
things they could find, and brought them
out to a shady place, for it was a fine spring
day and getting quite warm, and Mr.
'Possum showed them a round tree, quite
large, that had blown down during the
winter, and told them they might saw it in
two, first, and then cut off four nice slices,
two large and two smaller ones, for the four
wheels. Mr. 'Possum sat down on the end
of the log and showed them just how to take
hold of the saw, one at each end, and pull
first one way and then the other, and
walked around and sighted across it to see
that they were keeping it straight, and got a
little cooking-grease and put on it, so it
would work faster, and Mr. 'Coon and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Crow worked, and sweat, and tugged, and
panted, and said it was wonderful exercise,
and by and by really did get the log sawed in
two.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum said they had done very well
for the first cut, which was always the
hardest, and that they'd all better rest and
smoke a little, as his mind was quite tired
with thinking. But in a few minutes he
said they might try now to make a wheel,
and see if they could do that as well; and
Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow went at it again,
and after a while got a slice of the tree cut
off, quite smooth and about an inch thick,
and Mr. 'Possum said it would make a very
good wheel, but that they would be likely
to improve with each slice, and that they
must be very careful to hold the saw just as
he told them.</p>

<p>So then they rested and cut off another
slice, and rested some more, and cut off
another slice, until they had four slices, and
were nearly ready to drop from being tired
and hot, and were saying how fine it was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
have that job done, when Mr. 'Possum
said that he had just remembered they
would need one more slice, for his steering-wheel.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow thought
they would surely die before they got the
last slice off, and Mr. 'Possum brought some
water and sprinkled a little on their foreheads,
and at last that wheel was done, too,
and they were all quite exhausted and lay in
the shade a while to rest and talk about it.
Mr. 'Possum said it might take a little longer
than he thought, to finish the automobile,
and that it was better not to hurry so, as
new thoughts were coming to him all the
time. He said that next year they would
make another and probably change the style
a good deal.</p>

<p>Then when they were rested he showed
them some nice straight limbs of the tree that
they could saw off for the axles, and when
they got those sawed off, which was easier
to do, of course, he measured them and
showed them how to shave the ends nice and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
smooth with Mr. Man's drawing-knife, and
how to cut out of a strong piece of board
some things he called brackets for the back
axle to turn in, because the back axle had
to turn, and how to bore holes with Mr.
Man's auger, in the back wheels, and drive
them on tight, and how to bore holes in the
front wheels and put them on loose with pegs
to hold them on, because the front wheels
have to turn, and how to bore a hole in the
middle of the front axle and in the bottom
of the big wood-box, for the steering-rod,
because the wood-box was going to be used
for the body, and the steering-rod would turn
the front axle and hold it to the body at the
same time.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum said that he had noticed that
on Mr. Man's car the steering-rod did not
stand straight up, but slanted a good deal,
which seemed to him a mistake; no doubt if
Mr. Man could see their car he would have
his changed. Then the 'Coon and the Old
Black Crow said, "Of course," and that there
never was anybody so smart to invent things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
as Mr. 'Possum, and that it was too bad he
couldn't go over and suggest thoughts to
Mr. Man.</p>

<p>The Hollow Tree people didn't get their
car done that first day, but they got it a good
deal more than half done, and could hardly
wait to get at it next morning. They
hurried out right after breakfast, and Mr.
'Possum had Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow
sawing, and boring, and shaving with Mr.
Man's drawing-knife, making the crank,
which was a sort of double windlass that
stood up in the car over the back axle, built
so two people could turn it; and there
would be a strong strap that went down
through a hole in the bottom of the car and
around the axle to make that turn, too,
which would drive the car. Then Mr.
'Possum showed them how to make a seat
for the front of the box, so he could sit on
it and drive and steer, because that was the
hardest thing to do, while Mr. Crow and Mr.
'Coon only had to be the motor and work
the windlass. Then they got the strap off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of Mr. 'Coon's trunk, because it was a very
strong one, and put it on, and tightened it up,
and Mr. 'Possum said as far as he could see
there was nothing more to be done with his
car, now, but to use it. Of course he might
think of new things later, to attach to it,
but he didn't see how he could improve it at
present, and that they'd better take it out to
the race-track and try it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="348" height="450" alt="SO THEN MR. &#39;POSSUM GOT UP INTO THE SEAT TO STEER" title="" />
<span class="caption">SO THEN MR. &#39;POSSUM GOT UP INTO THE SEAT TO STEER</span>
</div>

<p>So then Mr. 'Possum got up into the seat
to steer, and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow
pushed, but it went pretty hard, until they
put some grease on the wheels and transmission;
after that it went better, but
squeaked so loud that you could hear it all
through the Big Deep Woods, and Mr.
Rabbit came kiting over, and Mr. Robin
and Mr. Squirrel came skipping among the
trees, and Mr. Turtle came waddling up
from the Wide Blue Water, to see what new
thing was going on over at the Hollow Tree.
And when they saw what the Hollow Tree
people had made they could hardly speak for
their surprise. And when they found out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
how Mr. 'Possum had done all the hardest
part&mdash;the planning it and showing how&mdash;they
said they had never been so proud in
their lives, just to be his friend, and they all
helped push it over to the race-track, and
when they got there Mr. 'Possum invited
Mr. Rabbit to sit in the front seat beside
him, because Mr. Rabbit was an author and
would want to write something about it;
and Mr. Robin and Mr. Squirrel and Mr.
Turtle went down the track a piece to see
them dash by.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Crow and Mr. 'Coon took hold
of the windlass, and Mr. 'Possum told them
not to start too suddenly or go too fast at
first, as it might injure the transmission,
which was quite delicate. So Mr. 'Coon and
Mr. Crow put a little strength on the windlass,
but it didn't turn. Then they put
some more on it, but it didn't turn. Then
they put all they had on it and it turned just
a little bit, but very slow. Mr. 'Possum said
he didn't think it would be dangerous to go
a little faster, and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
turned with every bit of strength they had,
and worked harder even than they had at
sawing up the log, but still Mr. 'Possum said
he didn't believe they were going quite as
fast as Mr. Man's car had traveled, and Mr.
Turtle called to them that perhaps if he and
the others pushed until they got it to going
well, and the machinery warmed up, it might
run better.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum didn't much like to have his
car pushed, but he said that Mr. Man's
car didn't always start well, either, and very
likely had to be pushed sometimes. So
then Mr. Turtle and Mr. Squirrel got one
on each corner, and Mr. Robin went ahead
to kick stones out of the road, and Mr.
'Possum said "Ready!" and everybody did
his best, and the Deep Woods automobile
squeaked and squealed and started down the
race-track pretty fast, but not always keeping
in the middle of it, because Mr. 'Possum
couldn't steer perfectly the first time, and
went from one side of the road to the other,
and said it was because they didn't push<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
evenly, and he was as proud as could be of
his great invention. Then Mr. Squirrel and
Mr. Turtle gave it one big push, and let go,
and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow ground away
at the windlass their level best, and the car
went on quite a ways before it stopped. It
wouldn't have stopped then if Mr. 'Coon and
Mr. Crow hadn't given clean out and let
go of the crank and hung over the sides of
the car and said it was all so exciting and they
were enjoying it so much that they were
quite overcome.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="347" height="375" alt="GOING FASTER AND FASTER EVERY MINUTE" title="" />
<span class="caption">GOING FASTER AND FASTER EVERY MINUTE</span>
</div>

<p>Then Mr. Turtle said <i>he</i> had an idea. He
said down not far from his house which stood
by the Wide Blue Water there was a smooth
road with a good deal of a slant in it, and that
if the car was over there and got started down
that slant it would very likely almost run
itself and move a good deal faster. So they
all said yes, that was just the thing, and
everybody but Mr. 'Possum took hold and
pushed, because Mr. 'Possum had to steer;
and by and by they got to the slanting road,
which was really quite a hill, and Mr. Rabbit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
got in again by Mr. 'Possum, and Mr.
'Coon and Mr. Crow took hold of the windlass,
and sure enough, that time, the car
started well enough, and went without any
trouble at all. Mr. Turtle and the others
had run a good ways down the road to see
them pass, and pretty soon they did pass,
going faster and faster every minute, and
everybody cheered and waved, and Mr.
'Possum called back to Mr. 'Coon and Mr.
Crow that they could turn a little slower, so
all could enjoy the scenery.</p>

<p>But Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow <i>couldn't</i>
turn any slower, and when they tried to
hold back on the crank it just jerked them
right around, and when they let go entirely
they went even faster, for that slanting road
had turned into a real hill, and they were
going down it as speedy as Mr. Man would
go down, and perhaps speedier, and Mr.
'Possum wasn't looking at the scenery
any more, but was holding as fast as he
could to the steering-wheel; trying to keep
in the road, and not doing it the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in the world, though nobody was pushing
now.</p>

<p>Then all at once Mr. 'Possum saw something
that scared him&mdash;scared him so he
nearly fainted away, for just then they
rounded a turn, going lickety-split, and
right in front of him Mr. 'Possum saw the
Wide Blue Water. They were headed
straight for it, and Mr. 'Possum's thoughts
became confused. He could only realize
two things clearly&mdash;one was that he had
forgotten all about putting brakes on his
car, to stop with, and the other was that he
<i>must</i> stop without delay, or they would all
disappear in the Wide Blue Water, and that
he couldn't swim.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum wondered very rapidly what
would stop them, and just then he saw a little
tree ahead, right at the side of the road, and
he thought <i>that</i> would probably do it. He
couldn't think of anything <i>but</i> that, and he
steered for the tree as straight as he could,
which wasn't so very straight, for he hit on
the bias.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, that was enough to stop the car, but
not the people in it. Mr. 'Possum himself
flew into a thick blackberry-patch and lost
consciousness; Mr. Rabbit sailed clear over
the blackberry-patch, and landed in a boggy
place, which was soft enough, but quite
splashy; Mr. 'Coon went straight up into
the little tree they had hit, and grabbed
some limbs and hung on, while Mr. Crow just
opened his wings, though he hadn't used
them for ever so long, and went sailing over
to a nice grassy place by the road, and wasn't

</div>

<p>There wasn't really anything fatally damaged
except the automobile. When Mr.
'Possum came to, and Mr. Rabbit cleaned
some of the bog off of himself, and Mr. Crow
came back, and Mr. 'Coon climbed down,
and the others caught up with them, they
all looked around to see what they could
find of Mr. 'Possum's invention. Some of
it was in the bushes and some in the tree,
and two of the wheels they couldn't find at
all. Mr. 'Coon said his trunk-strap was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
good as ever, which was more than Mr.
Crow could say for his wood-box. Mr.
'Possum, who limped and seemed suffering,
said, when he looked at what they had
gathered, that he felt just about as his car
looked&mdash;a good deal broken up and hardly
worth carrying home. Then he said that
very likely Mr. Man had had the same
experience with his first car, and that next
year's model would be different in several
ways.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Turtle took Mr. 'Possum on his
back, and everybody said it was very fine
for the first time, and certainly most exciting,
and the Hollow Tree people invited all the
others to the Hollow Tree to celebrate
Mr. 'Possum's great invention. They stayed
quite late, and when Mr. Rabbit started
home he said he would certainly write a poem
on all the events.</p>

<h2>HOW MR. 'POSSUM'S TAIL<br />
BECAME BARE</h2><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h3>MR. 'POSSUM RELATES SOME VERY CURIOUS
FAMILY HISTORY</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time, when it was a very
pleasant afternoon, and the Hollow Tree
people were sitting along the edge of the
world, hanging their feet over and thinking,
Mr. 'Possum went to sleep, and would have
nodded himself off into the Deep Nowhere if
his strong, smooth tail hadn't been quite
firmly hooked around a little bush just
behind him. All the others noticed it, and
said how lucky it was that a person of Mr.
'Possum's habits had a nice, useful tail like
that, which allowed him to sleep in a position
that for some was thought dangerous even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to be awake in. Then they wondered how
it happened that Mr. 'Possum's family had
been gifted in that peculiar way, and by and
by, when he woke up, and stretched, and
moved back in the shade, and leaned against
a stump to smoke, they asked him.</div>

<p>Mr. 'Possum said it was a very old story,
because it had happened about a hundred and
fifty-six great-grandfathers back. He had
heard it when he was quite small, he said,
and would have to think some, to get it
straight. So then he shut his eyes and
smoked very slowly, and about the time the
Deep Woods people thought he was going
to sleep again he began telling.</p>

<p>"My family is a very ancient one," he
said&mdash;"one of the oldest in the Big Deep
Woods, and there used to be only a few,
even of us. That was when Mr. Painter, or
Panther, as we say now, was King of the
Deep Woods, and he was very fond of our family,
which helped to make them scarce, and
was one reason why they got to slipping out at
night for food, when Mr. Painter was asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were a pretty poor lot in those days,
and whenever Mr. Painter took after one
of my ancestors that ancestor would make
for a tree and run out on a limb that was too
small to bear up Mr. Painter, and just
cling there, because Mr. Painter would climb
up, too, and shake the limb, and very often
he would shake an ancestor down, like a
papaw, and the only thing to do then was to
make for another tree, or if the next tree
was too far, to play dead, because Mr.
Painter did not much like anything he hadn't
killed himself. That is how we got the
playing-dead habit, which others sometimes
try and call it 'playing 'possum,' because
nobody can do it so well as our family, and
I judge some of our family didn't do it
perfectly the one and only chance they got
to try it, or else Mr. Painter was smarter,
or hungrier, at those times.</p>

<p>"Well, my ancestors got so that they could
hold to those limbs very firmly with their
hands and feet, and Mr. Painter had a hard
time to shake them down, though he didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
like to give up, and would go on shaking all
day, sometimes, until my folks would get
tired out. They used to try to hold and
brace themselves with their tails, too, but we
had just big, ornamental tails in those days,
covered with thick, bushy hair, and of very
little use, like Mr. Squirrel's and Mr.
'Coon's."</p>

<p>When Mr. 'Possum made that remark,
Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Squirrel sat up quite
straight, and were just about to say something,
but Mr. Rabbit motioned to them
and said "'Sh!" and Mr. 'Possum went right
on, without noticing that anything had
happened.</p>

<p>"Those tails were no manner of account,
but just in the way, and some of my folks
thought it would be almost better if they
didn't have them at all, but just a funny
bunch of cotton, or something, like Mr.
Rabbit's."</p>

<p>When Mr. 'Possum said that, Mr. Rabbit
sat up quite straight, and was just about to
say something, but Mr. 'Coon and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Squirrel motioned to him and said "'Sh!"
and Mr. 'Possum didn't notice anything had
happened.</p>

<p>"You see," he went right on, "every little
while it happened that one of my ancestors
would start up the tree not quite soon enough,
and Mr. Painter would just manage to get
his claws in that bushy ornament, which
would settle it for that ancestor, right
away. Of course, my family were proud
of those big, plumy things, people being
generally proud of their most useless
property, something they would be better
off, and live longer, without. My folks
thought those great tails were handsome,
especially our young people, who would
walk about waving them and practise carrying
them in new positions, and about
once a week would do up the long, thick fur
on them in little knots, tied with tough,
twisted grass, which would make the hair
curl and look very showy indeed. Even
some of my ancestors who happened to get
old acted in that foolish way, and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
fur got thin would wear some kind of false
stuff, though any one but a blind person
could always tell it.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;ONE DAY A NEW AND VERY HANDSOME MR. &#39;POSSUM CAME INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, one day a new and very handsome
Mr. 'Possum came into the neighborhood,
from some place nobody had ever heard
of before, and none of our folks had ever seen
anything like him. He was stouter than our
breed and lighter colored, and had a very
long, bushy tail that curved in a peculiar
way and stayed beautifully curled, without
ever being put up in grass at all. He
said so, and my ancestors watched him, to
prove it.</p>

<p>"That young man called himself Somers,
and he certainly became popular with the
young Miss 'Possums of our section. They
went crazy over him, and of course that made
all the young Mr. 'Possums jealous of him,
though they would have given anything to
be like him. They knew they couldn't
be that, so they hoped something would
happen to him, and used to tell him of nice
new and interesting walks to take when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
thought Mr. Painter might be in that
neighborhood. Then they would follow, and
hide around in the bushes and watch,
expecting some time to see Mr. Painter get
his claws into that curly blond duster before
Somers could reach a limb, or shake him
down afterward.</p>

<p>"Well, just as they expected, one day
when Somers went out for a little promenade
alone Mr. Painter happened along, but
Somers saw him first, and made for a tree,
with Mr. Painter after him, reaching for
that fine plume and just missing it, as the
handsome stranger went up the tree and out
on a limb, with Mr. Painter right behind
and making very savage noises. Then he
began shaking the limb as hard as he could,
and my ancestors, who were watching from
quite a safe place, thought Somers would
drop pretty soon, for they didn't think he
could be trained to holding on&mdash;such a fine
person as he was.</p>

<p>"So they watched, very hopeful, and sure
enough, about the third hard shake Somers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
dropped&mdash;just let go with his hands and
feet, and rolled off, almost as if he really
didn't care. My ancestors said that was
what it looked like, and that was what it
was. Somers didn't care at all, for when he
let go and dropped, he didn't fall, but just
swung off into space, and stayed attached
to that limb, hanging head down, by his
tail!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="308" height="400" alt="&quot;CALLING OUT, &#39;MUCH OBLIGED, MR. PAINTER&#39;&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;CALLING OUT, &#39;MUCH OBLIGED, MR. PAINTER&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"My ancestors had never been so
astonished in their lives, nor Mr. Painter,
either. He couldn't believe it. He thought
at first Somers had got caught, somehow,
and gave one more shake, but when Somers
swung back and forth, laughing and calling
out, 'Much obliged, Mr. Painter&mdash;much
obliged for the nice swing!' Mr. Painter
climbed down and took out for home as
hard as he could, without looking behind
him, for he thought it was some kind of
magic. And pretty soon Somers climbed
down, too, and brushed himself off a little,
and fixed his tail in a nice position, and
walked along, smiling; and my ancestors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hurried to him and said they had just arrived
in time to witness his great performance,
and begged him to show them how he did it,
and offered him anything if he would only
teach them to handle those useless ornaments
of theirs in that grand way.</p>

<p>"So then Somers told them all about it.
He said he was the inventor of the idea, and
of the medicine that made it work. He said
he was very soon going back to his own
people, but before he went he would make
up some medicine, which would make their
hair and tails both curl, and would explain
how to take it.</p>

<p>"Well, they were so anxious about it that
he began next morning, and sent out different
ones for different things&mdash;special kinds of
roots, and several sorts of very twisty things,
such as grape-vine clingers, and honeysuckle,
and a great lot of love-vine&mdash;that
yellow stuff that winds about everything
and can choke even a ragweed to death.
Then he put it all into a big kettle, and had
them pour water on it and put a fire under it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and he boiled it for two days and nights,
without letting the fire get down, and after
that poured it off into a big gourd to settle,
and told them just what size swallow to take
of it, and how to practise the new habit
when they felt the curling begin. Then he
said he must be going, as his family would be
worried about him being away so long, and
my folks all gathered to see him off, and gave
him as many presents as he could carry, and
he went away somewhere to the southeast,
and they never saw him again.</p>

<p>"Of course, as soon as he was gone, and
the medicine was settled nice and clear, our
whole family collected to take it. There
wasn't a 'possum in the Deep Woods that
wasn't there, and they had to get in line,
because every one wanted to be first and be
sure to get some of that magic juice.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="350" height="450" alt="&quot;MR. WATERS HAD TO TAKE WHAT WAS LEFT&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MR. WATERS HAD TO TAKE WHAT WAS LEFT&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, perhaps they were too anxious,
and took bigger swallows than Somers told
them to, or it may be the stuff was a little
too strong, or Somers got in too much of the
love-vine, which has such an awful twist;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
or it may be he wanted to play a joke on
some of our family for being jealous and
wanting to get him caught by Mr. Painter&mdash;whatever
it was, that medicine had an awful
power and did even more than he said it
would. When every one had taken a good
swallow, except the last one in line&mdash;he being
a middle-aged person named Waters, who had
to take what was left, which was only about
a spoonful and very disappointing to Mr.
Waters&mdash;they all felt the curling sensation
begin, and commenced the new muscle-practice
Somers had mentioned; and just
then Mr. Painter, who had probably heard
that Somers had gone, came tearing through
the timber, and my folks quit practising and
broke for trees and limbs, with Mr. Painter
after one plump young chap which he didn't
quite get, and pretty soon was shaking a
limb in the usual way, only harder, being
hungrier than common. The plump young
person was scared half to death, never having
had much practice holding on, anyway, and
in about a minute he was obliged to let go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with his hands and feet, and just give up
everything, shut his eyes, and drop, expecting
next minute he would hit the ground and it
would be all over.</p>

<p>"But right there that plump young fellow
got the best surprise of his life. He had been
so scared that he had forgotten all about Mr.
Somers's medicine, but the medicine hadn't
forgotten about him. During the little
minute he had been sitting on that limb his
tail had curled itself around it as tight as if
it had grown there. Mr. Painter couldn't
have shaken him loose in a week. He hung
down just like Somers, only not so far, and
he didn't swing much, because that strong
medicine had taken up all his slack and
there was very little room for play. He
didn't care for that, of course, not then. He
got brave and very cheerful right off, and
called out to Mr. Painter, just like Somers:</p>

<p>"'Much obliged, Mr. Painter&mdash;much
obliged for the nice swing. Swing me again,
Mr. Painter.'</p>

<p>"And when the rest of our folks saw that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the same thing had happened to all of them
they all let go and dropped, and began
calling from the different trees: 'Come and
swing us, too, Mr. Painter&mdash;stay all day and
swing the rest of us!'</p>

<p>"And when Mr. Painter heard that, and
looked around and saw all my ancestors
hanging head down and making fun of him,
he thought the whole Deep Woods was full
of the strange magic, and he piled down out
of that tree and took out for the bushes, and
was never seen in the Big Deep Woods
again.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="333" height="460" alt="&quot;TOOK HIM ALL THE AFTERNOON TO PRY THE REST OF MY ANCESTORS LOOSE&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;TOOK HIM ALL THE AFTERNOON TO PRY THE REST OF MY ANCESTORS LOOSE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"My folks called after him just as far as
they could see him, and when they were sure
he was gone they thought they would come
down and celebrate. But they didn't do
it&mdash;not just yet. There wasn't one of them
that could unwind himself from his limb,
except old Mr. Waters, who had got only a
teaspoonful of the medicine, which very
likely was just about the right amount. Mr.
Waters swung quite loose and free from his
limb, and got down without much trouble,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and it took him all the afternoon to go around
from tree to tree and pry the rest of my
ancestors loose, and unwind them, because
those new-fangled tails would snap together
like springs, and it took several days' steady
practice and straightening before they were
really useful at a moment's notice. By that
time another strange thing had happened:
The fur on them had curled so tight at first
that it was like very close wool; then it kept
right on getting tighter and tighter until it
seemed to curl itself clear out, and by the
end of the week there wasn't one of our
family whose tail wasn't as bare as your hand,
except old Mr. Waters, who had a handsome
curly plume, like Somers's, and became a
great curiosity, the only one that we ever
had like that in our tribe.</p>

<p>"All the others thought the fur would grow
again, but it never did, and when they got
used to its absence they decided they were
much better off without it, especially since
they had learned the Somers habit, which
they said worked easier and better in the new,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
smooth form. They were sorry, at first,
that Mr. Somers had not left them the
recipe for that medicine, on account of the
new little 'Possums that would be coming
along. But they didn't need the recipe.
That medicine was strong enough, the
amount they took, to do our family at least
a thousand generations, and maybe more.
Somers never came back, and they never
heard of him again. Some of my ancestors
used to say that he was not a real person at
all, but something that could take different
shapes and work magic, just as Mr. Painter
believed he did. Anyhow, he was a great
blessing to our family, as you may have
noticed."</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum moved over to the Edge
of the World in the sun, hooked his tail
about the same little bush, and went to
sleep again. The other Deep Woods people
looked at the way he did it, as if it was
something new that they had never seen
before.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon said: "I think I'd like a little,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
just a little, of that medicine; Mr. 'Possum's
gift certainly would come handy at times."</p>

<p>Mr. Squirrel nodded.</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit looked out over the Deep
Nowhere, and said nothing at all.</p>
